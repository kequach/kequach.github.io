Alongside my technical work, I enjoy collaborating with customers, presenting, and teaching. I have designed and facilitated customer and internal workshops, organized hackathons, delivered conference presentations on my research and master’s thesis, and served on the board of a student consulting group responsible for external relations. Presenting comes naturally to me, supported by several years of teaching experience.
    Currently, I am working for Bosch at Bosch Connected Industry. I also hold a Master degree in Business Informatics from Utrecht University. Outside of work, you can find me playing table tennis or in the boulder hall.
